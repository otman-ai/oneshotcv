# OneShotCV
OneShotCV is a library for a simplifies visual design and rendering of computer vision tasks such as drawing bounding boxes, masks, labels, etc .

We want to make the tailwindcss of computer vision and start focusing on the important things rather then handling the headache of text and colors in opencv and Pillow .

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/otman-ai/oneshotcv.git
```

## Usage
After installation you can import the package and start using it

You can add box with its label
```python
from oneshotcv import Draw
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open("assets/image.jpg")
bbox  = (100, 100, 400, 400)
# draw bbox 
new_image = Draw.box(bbox, 
                    image,
                    label="Persone",
                    overlayAlpha=50 # in range of 0-255
                    )
# save the image
new_image.save("assets/image_with_bbox.png")
```

Or just casual text
```python
new_image = Draw.add_text(image, "Hi this is text", 
                          position="top-left", 
                          color="white",
                          size="xl" # extra-large
                          )
```

## Features :
- Draw a beautiful box with its label around an object in a single line without frustriting with the parameters of opencv or Pillow
- Predifined colors to choose from 
- add text to the image in a dynamic way , no hardcoded size or position

## Milestone :
- [X] Make the repo installable as python package
- [X] create `pyproject.toml`
- [X] draw box
- [X] add text as label
- [X] add predefined colors
- [X] Add casual text with dynamic position
    - center, top-left, top-right, top-center, bottom-right, 
bottom-left, bottom-center, right-center, left-center
- [X] Support dynamic text size
- [ ] Support multiple fonts
- [ ] Support mask with overlay option
