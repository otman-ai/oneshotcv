# OneShotCV
OneShotCV is a library for a simplifies visual design and rendering of computer vision tasks such as drawing bounding boxes, masks, labels, etc .

We want to make the tailwindcss of computer vision and start focusing on the important things rather then handling the headache of text and colors in opencv and Pillow .

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/otman-ai/oneshotcv.git
```

## Usage :
After installation you can import the package and start using it

```
from oneshotcv import Draw
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open("assets/image.jpg")
bbox  = (100, 100, 400, 400)
# draw bbox 
new_image = Draw.box(bbox, 
                    image,
                    label="Persone",
                    overlayAlpha=50 # in range of 0-255
                    )
# save the image
new_image.save("assets/image_with_bbox.png")
```
